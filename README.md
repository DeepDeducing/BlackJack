# Deep Deducing on BlackJack

This repository contains codes of deep deducing solving the black jack problems.
We present two different ways to solve black jack problem. The first one does not take the action of the dealer into consideration whereas the second type (adverarial type) does take the action into consideration.
To reproduce the results in the paper, simply run Deducing.py


## Requirements

Packages requirements:

```

## Learning phase
To train sets of weight matrices in the paper, run this command:

```
Learning.py            
```


## Deducing phase
To use sets of trained weight matrices to start deducing, run this command:

```
Deducing.py              
```
